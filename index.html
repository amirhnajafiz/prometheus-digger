					<h2>
						Factors
					</h2>
					<br />
					<p class="x-p">
						Four significant factors impact the performance of a Virtual Machine: 
						<span style="color: rgb(25, 165, 25);">
							memory, cpu, disk, and network.
						</span> 
						As each of these components makes up the entirety of your physical 
						infrastructure, they are all connected intrinsically. 
						A <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 51);">misconfiguration or improper allocation of one resource</span> will impact 
						the whole environment’s performance.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>
						Processors (CPU)
					</h2>
					<p class="x-p">
						Insufficient hardware resources are among the most popular reasons for slow VM performance. 
						If you <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 51);">don't</span> provide enough CPU resources for a VM, software inside the 
						VM might run slowly with lags. To fix this, set a VM to use more CPU cores or add more virtual 
						processors. Also, consider upgrading the hardware of your host machine 
						if you have an old processor with a low number of cores, cache, and low frequency.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Bottlenecks
					</h4>
					<ul>
						<li class="x-p">
							The first scenario is when you run a time-consuming operation on a single processor, 
						which lags the circuit.
						</li>
						<li class="x-p">
							The second scenario is a multi-thread operation eating up all your processing power, 
							negatively impacting the VM processes. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<p class="x-p">
						There are two ways to fix this issue. 
						You can either increase the processing power or allocated processing cores for your VM, 
						or overclock the existing cores to enable processes to complete faster. 
					</p>

					<h2>
						Memory
					</h2>
					<p class="x-p">
						Memory overcommitment is a situation when total resource allocation exceeds capacity. 
						If you have a host with 8 GB of RAM and run five VMs configured to use 2 GB of RAM each, 
						all VMs and the host machine can show low performance because the 
						memory is <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 51);">overcommitted</span> (if all VMs are using memory intensively).
						<br />
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li class="x-p">
								The first situation is that your Virtual Machine is simply caching processes on 
								the memory and moving active threads to storage. 
								This can be easily remedied by setting a <span style="color: rgb(25, 165, 25);">fixed cache limit</span> for your memory. 
							</li>
							<li class="x-p">
								The second way the memory can be causing bottlenecks is to be over-utilized and 
								clogged by the multi-thread or extensive operations being carried out by your processors. 
								Making the switch to storage should be discouraged, and you should allocate the required memory to your VM correctly.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="x-p">
						Monitoring the Committed Memory metrics using analytics and monitoring software 
						is the better way to go instead of merely relying on the windows task manager.

					<h2>
						Network
					</h2>
					<p class="x-p">
						A significant factor contributing to bottlenecks for your VM is the network, 
						as most processes require a persistent connection to operate. 
						Although the network’s speed is the first thing to configure correctly, 
						it is usually not the leading cause of bottlenecks. This is related to VMs as well.
						<br />
						As most Virtual Machines will undoubtedly be running on a high-speed connection, 
						the issues that can cause bottlenecks for your VM are related to the network’s 
						configuration and its protocols connected to the VM Environment. 
						By monitoring the outgoing port connections, you can 
						determine whether or not there may be an IP conflict. 
						<br />
						<br />
						A misconfigured port on your server, causing bottlenecks and redundancy on your 
						Virtual Machine, is also a possibility. 
						A thorough network diagnostic can turn up metrics that shed light on the sockets 
						connecting to your network through the VM, 
						for which it is best to use a comprehensive monitoring suite.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Conclution
					</h2>
					<p class="x-p">
						You should have hardware that provides enough performance, 
						avoid memory overcommitment, and configure software properly. 
						Use VM performance monitoring to detect why VM performance is slow.
